# Sidekick

A CLI tool that understands your natural language commands and executes them for you.

It's simple, just ask your sidekick to do something ðŸ˜Š:

```console
$ sk push to gh
Step #1
Command: git status
Check repo status first (1 - read-only)

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Step #2
Command: git add README.md
Stage modified README.md file (2 - local change only)

Step #3
Command: git commit -m "Update README.md"
Commit staged changes (2 - local change only)

[main b4fa01c] Update README.md
 1 file changed, 43 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

Step #4
Command: git push
Push commits to remote (3 - network operation)
```

A special command `sk --fix` exists that checks `tmux`'s pane output for errors and attempts to fix them.

```console
$ python avg.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/stephen/Projects/sidekick/avg.py", line 7, in <module>
    print("Average:", avg(numbers))
                      ~~~^^^^^^^^^
  File "/home/stephen/Projects/sidekick/avg.py", line 3, in avg
    average = total / len(numbers)
              ~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

$ sk --fix
Step #1
Command: cat avg.py
Need to see code content first to fix division by zero (1 - read only)

def avg(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

numbers = []
print("Average:", avg(numbers))

Step #2
Command: echo 'def avg(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average

numbers = []
print("Average:", avg(numbers))' > avg.py
Fix division by zero by checking empty list (3 - modifies file)
```
